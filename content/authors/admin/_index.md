 I am a MS in computer science student at Umass, Amherst with a focus on data science and distributed systems.
 I am interested in using data science to build large-scale systems  which have a positive impact on society.
 I am eager to learn how to convert raw data into insights and tools which can be used in large-scale commercial platforms.
       Prior to my masters, I used to work at Oracle as an applications engineer
 in the fusion order management team and at Goldman Sachs as a summer analyst.
 In my free time I like to paint, practice yoga, trek and travel.
