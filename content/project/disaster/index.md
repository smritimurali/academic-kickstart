<ul>
<li align='justify'>
The aim of the project was to build a crowd sourced platform which can be used during a disaster to aggregation, disseminate and analyze important information needed for coordinating rescue and relief operations.
<li align='justify'>
We designed a multi-platform model in which data in different formats from various sources is first processed using NLP tools and then validated using crowdsourcing validation algorithms.
<li align='justify'>
Worked on algorithms to best match available resources to those who need it.
