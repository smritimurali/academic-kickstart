title: "Probabilistic graphical models"
summary: "Build a Bayesian network for heart disease prediction according to the random variables and dependencies and calculated the conditional probability tables for each variable given training data. Perform marginal and MAP queries on the calculated conditional probability distribution of single variables given a configuration of the other random variables in the graph which possibly contain unobserved variables other than the query variable

Built a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) for optical character recognition (OCR) with binary pixel values as features and the ten most commonly used letters of the alphabet as labels. Implement the message-passing dynamic-programming algorithm for MAP inference on markov networks. Implement learning by optimizing the parameters for OCR on the given data set using an optimizer from SciPy .

Built a grid-structured conditional random field (CRF) for image denoising with noisy pixel values as features and correct pixel values as labels. Implement a by-pixel Gibbs sampler for the grid-structured CRF.
