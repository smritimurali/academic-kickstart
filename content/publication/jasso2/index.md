abstract: "The success of IoT (Internet of Things) depends upon the inclusion of many
cross platform heterogeneous devices which have severe memory, energy, processing
power and communication bandwidth constraints. A real-time application is expected to
process data instantly without buffering delays or jitter. Contiki, an open source OS,
provides only partial support for such operations. In this paper, we examine how Coffee
is better than CFS-POSFIX for real-time operations and validate it by running a
simulation on Cooja. We further explore Coffee’s prominent features such as garbage
collection, wear levelling, etc. We suggest improvements to reduce the unpredictable
delays caused by long tasks like file extension and garbage collection. We then examine
how latencies in file operations can be reduced to enhance its real time performance."
